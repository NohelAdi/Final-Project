This is my repository is for my final project for MGS 406. I have bulit a system for students at University at Buffalo. The first page is a student homepage that has links to both the student registeration page and student information page. This system is to help students access all the necessary pages that they need in order to find success. I have used html to make the webpages and a python file under manage.py to tie all of them together into one entity. There is a database that was made in mysql where I have a students table with all the information about students.
